Support Agent Chatbot for Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)

Overview

This project involves building a chatbot designed to answer "how-to" questions related to four prominent Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot utilizes information from the official documentation of these platforms to guide users on performing tasks or achieving specific outcomes.

Objective

To develop a user-friendly chatbot capable of:

Answering specific "how-to" questions about Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.

Extracting relevant information from official documentation to provide accurate and actionable responses.

Handling variations in question phrasing and terminology.

Optionally providing advanced features such as cross-CDP comparisons and addressing complex queries.

Core Functionalities

1. Answer "How-to" Questions

The chatbot responds to user queries about performing specific tasks or using features within each CDP.

Example Queries:

"How do I set up a new source in Segment?"

"How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"

"How do I build an audience segment in Lytics?"

"How can I integrate my data with Zeotap?"

2. Extract Information from Documentation

Navigates the provided official documentation to retrieve relevant information.

Identifies the appropriate sections and extracts actionable steps or guidance.

3. Handle Variations in Questions

Can interpret and respond to differently phrased or lengthy questions.

Effectively filters out irrelevant questions, such as non-CDP-related queries (e.g., "Which movie is getting released this week?").

Bonus Features

Cross-CDP Comparisons

The chatbot compares features or processes across the four CDPs.

Example Query: "How does Segment's audience creation process compare to Lytics'?"

Advanced "How-to" Questions

Handles complex queries about advanced configurations, integrations, or use cases for each CDP.

Functional Features

Dynamic Query Understanding: Parses and understands user queries in natural language.

Documentation Integration: Leverages official documentation to provide detailed responses.

Robust Error Handling: Identifies and filters out irrelevant queries.

User-Friendly Interface: Ensures intuitive interactions for seamless user experience.

Non-Functional Features

Scalability: The chatbot design supports future extensions to include additional CDPs.

Performance: Ensures quick response times by indexing and efficiently searching documentation.

Reliability: Handles diverse query structures without crashing or returning incomplete results.

Maintainability: The code is modular and well-documented to facilitate updates and improvements.

Implementation Details

Technologies Used

Flask: A lightweight web framework to build the chatbot API.

BeautifulSoup: For parsing and extracting content from HTML documentation.

Requests: To fetch HTML content from CDP documentation URLs.

Python: The primary programming language for the chatbot.



Code Structure

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import random

app = Flask(_name_)

# A simple function to mimic a chatbot response
def get_chatbot_response(question):
    # For now, we're just responding with a simple random reply
    responses = [
        "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.",
        "Can you clarify your question?",
        "I'm here to help!",
        "That's a great question!"
     ] return random.choice(responses)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the chatbot API!"

@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    data = request.get_json()  # Get the data from the POST request
    user_question = data.get('question')

    # Get a response from the chatbot function
    answer = get_chatbot_response(user_question)

    # Return the response as JSON
    return jsonify({'answer': answer})

if _name_ == "_main_":
    app.run(debug=True)
app.py


How to Use the Chatbot

Start the Flask application by running app.py.

Use the /ask endpoint to submit a "how-to" query related to any of the four CDPs.

Send a POST request with a JSON payload containing the user's question.

The chatbot will respond with an appropriate answer or clarification message.

For unsupported queries, the chatbot will notify you and suggest reformulating the question.

Future Enhancements

Integration with Voice Assistants: Enable voice-based queries for enhanced accessibility.

Multi-Language Support: Extend support for queries in multiple languages.

Enhanced AI Models: Incorporate advanced AI to improve query understanding and response accuracy.
